the code has all pip install + the needed library so it will run direct
the main things that have to be downloaded are: 
- glove.6B.100d.txt was used as pretrained model 
-	Gensim  last versin
- 	word2vec-google-news-300 

you dont have to generate the dataset from scrach by running the preprocessing code,
just use the dataset included in this file (mstafa data.scv)
in addition, the EM takes too much time to run and craches google colab- i used my local
device to run it
